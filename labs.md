We meet in the laboratory (ETC 211) every Tuesday to tinker around with data and
statistics. Our tool of choice is R, software that vastly amplifies 
your power to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed's RStudio Server is 
accessible by going to <https://rstudio.reed.edu/> 
and using your college login. Note that to access the server from off-campus,
you'll need to go through a VPN. You can apply to CUS for access by filling out
[this form](https://docs.google.com/a/reed.edu/forms/d/1oMG4c732c2CAPXr9oGni45lz3-UyDKIfKPMaXKXH6pU/viewform).

Every week you'll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an
RMarkdown document. You should complete work on your lab by **Thursday** at 11:59 PM.
